### What is HTML?

It is a Hyper Text Markup Language.abbrieviated as HTML used to create Web pages. Along with CSS and Javascripts HTML is a technology to create web pages, as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web applications. 
The Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages.

### What we have to write first for writing a HTML document?
The ``` Doctype ``` , Doctype is the declaration which is the very first thing before the ```<html>``` tag. It tells the browser about the description of the document. In the present days i.e the HTML5 era we write it as ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` , it is the standard of describing the browser that it is HTML5 document.

### HTML Block Level Elements and Inline Elements

Block level element always start in a new line and takes the full width. Examples ```div, p, h1 -  h6, p , form```

Inline Elements does not starts in a new line and takes the shape inside a line and takes as much with necessary.

Example ``` span, a , img ```. So never start with a span tag while creating a new block inside a HTML document. Further Reading http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp


All the HTML tags we write are validated by W3C standards.

### Basic HTML Tags
###### div
The ```<div>``` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The ```<div>``` tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.

###### span

The ```<span>``` tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.

###### html
The ```<html>``` tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag). It  tells the browser that this is an HTML document.

###### head

The ```<head>``` element is a container for all the head elements. All the styles, meta , title, scripts are written here.

###### article
The HTML ```<article>``` element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable . This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an object, or any other independent item of content. Each ```<article>``` should be identified, typically by including a heading (```<h1>-<h6>``` element) as a child of the ```<article>``` element.


###### aside
The HTML <aside> element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content. These sections are often represented as sidebars or inserts. They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions from the glossary; there may also be other types of information, such as related advertisements; the biography of the author; web applications; profile information or related links on the blog.

###### header

The HTML <header> element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, wrapped section's header, a search form, and so on.

###### section
The ```<section>``` tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
